### 🧠 About the Project

**SafeBiteAI** is an intelligent **food-safety and health-monitoring system** powered by AI.  
It analyzes your **food intake**, **medical data**, and **environmental factors** to predict health risks, unsafe food combinations, and dietary imbalances.

If a user gets sick and logs abnormal symptoms, the model predicts the **possible cause** based on previous food history — helping them **avoid harmful food or combinations** in the future.  
It also keeps track of the user's **weekly health metrics** like blood sugar and electrolyte balance — essential indicators of body regulation.  
Additionally, the system can **read and track medical reports** (uploaded via form or OCR scan) for holistic health monitoring.
